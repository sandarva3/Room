This is a file sharing program which enables very secure way to share files temporarily.

Any file can be shared of any size.

Uploader can choose time period while uploading. A room gets created and file is uploaded in that Room.
An unique key and link is provided to the uploader after uploading.
Only users with that particular key or link would be able to access those files.

After the initial time period of that room, which was set by uploader while uploading, expires then that room is destroyed permanently.
Nobody, not even the person who run this program, can access those files after they're expired.


This application was deployed and live for few days after I created it, months back.
Now, a more useful version of similar program exist and is live: www.roomapp.com  . It's very fast and can handle any file of any size(even movies).


There are few dependencies which needs to be installed before running this program. You can run it by installing them manually, there are only few.


Have a nice day.
